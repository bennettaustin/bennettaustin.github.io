# Machine Learning for Particle Physics
During my second year at Berkeley, I was offered the opportunity to join Professor [Heather Gray's](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/heather-gray) ATLAS research group at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.physics.lbl.gov/atlas/). During my time here, my advisor, Postdoc Tomohiro Yamazaki, and I worked on developing a method to increase the charm quark identification efficiency (known as "charm tagging") within machine learning classification algorithms.

Motivation for such research comes from the recently discovered Higgs-boson, an elementary particle giving rise to mass in other particles. Since the Higgs-boson was discovered in 2012, physicists have wanted to learn more about its properties. A method of doing so is by studying its decay modes (particles the Higgs-boson decays into). When the Higgs-boson decays into a charm quark, it
