## RSA Cryptopgraphy
RSA is a method of public key cryptography, which allows two people who have never met or talked before to communicate securely over a public server. I programmed an entire RSA cryptosystem from the ground up. The first steps required studying number theory in great detail to develop the tools and theorems that allow RSA to actually function. Such work included proving results about finite fields, primitive roots for Fp*, Euler's theorem for primes p and q, eth roots modulo p, the Miller-Rabin test, and Euler's phi function. From this, RSA can be built by merging several, smaller helper algorithms. These algorithms are as follows: computing exponents modulo some number N, computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers and their Bezout coefficients, converting text to integers and integers to text, solving for the eth root of a number modulo a product of primes, and a large prime number generator.
