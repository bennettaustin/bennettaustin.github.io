I am Bennett Austin, a third year mathematics student at [Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/). I am originally from the Metro-Detroit area in Michigan. 
On this website you can find information about my research, work, projects, and music. 

My research interests span many subjects, but, thus far, I have found myself particularly enjoying number theory (and, in general, algebra), cryptography, and machine learning. My research in machine learning is located [here](https://bennettaustin.github.io/research); and my number theory studies and crytpography projects are [here](https://bennettaustin.github.io/projects). Also, I have worked as a data scientist, of which you can read more about [here](https://bennettaustin.github.io/work).
