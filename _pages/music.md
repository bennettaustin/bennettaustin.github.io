In my free time, I enjoy playing music, typically jazz and psychedelic rock. I am self-taught in piano (and other keyboards such as organs and electric pianos), 
bass, guitar, and drums. My brothers and I have written many songs ranging from slow ballads to psychedelic jams to formal jazz compositions. Below are some
samples of the music I play and have written. I use Garageband to produce the music.
